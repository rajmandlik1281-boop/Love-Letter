I don’t know what the future looks like in detail, but I know one thing with absolute certainty that I want to face it with you bala💜💜💜. After all these years, you are still my calm, my comfort, and the place my heart naturally returns to✨.

I promise to choose you, not only when things are easy, but especially when they aren’t. I promise to hold your hand👫 through confusion, silence, distance, and change. I promise you that you have a new and the best Dhruv hereafter to care for you, to understand you, and to hold you like a baby in his arms honey🤗🤗🤗

I promise to grow with you, not away from you. To learn you deeper with time, not take you for granted. To protect what we have with patience, honesty, and effort.💗

You are not just someone I love, you are someone I respect, admire, and feel safe with. My heart feels steady with you, like it knows it’s finally where it belongs.

This is my promise: as long as I’m here, you will never walk alone. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.🤞🧿🧿

Always yours,
— Dhruv💟💝💓`;
